# Cardio-Man
#### CPSC 386 Unity Project - Programmed by Kinsey Vo and Anthony Tran

## Game
A character running across different screens collecting items and dodging dangerous objects. Users can choose their character instead of playing the default skin. Each level has a different background to give players a new and different environment. Additionally, progression through levels is done by collecting flags (blue triangles). As levels progress, more obstacles, such as coins, spikes, and collectibles will appear. If players can collect all the flags and collectibles scattered throughout all the levels, then they win. Players lose when they fail to capture the flag before time runs out.

## Controls
The controls are left and right arrows to move and spacebar to jump.

## Items
  - Coin: +5 Points
  - Health Box: +20 HP
  - Spike: -15 HP
  - Lava: -10 HP
  - Gem: 2x Points
